// Questions:
// is there a method to convert form data directly to json or a url encoded string
// when handling the form submission with JS? (if using method form attribute, query
// string is automatically generated and send as POST body).
//
// the search functionality is on the client side (not server side)
// if search was server side, you would send GET requests and update local
// element with responses.
//
// return statement in event handler function not working
//
// i could create an edit contact form, separate from create contact
// since submission of create contact and edit contact entails different
// behaviors. create contact is a POST request and edit contact is a PUT request.
//
// if the api has a PUT operation, do I have to use it ..? I can accomplish the same with
// POST. well i am asking if I will be penalised for it :)
//
// self.updateContacts();
//
// jquery loading at 500ms means you can see the forms before they are hidden
// but the forms are below the card-group .. ?
//
// how do you associate two different jquery libraries with their respective apps ..?
// this is with regards to your app, and jquery library used by bootstrap
//
// hannibal and gus hansen on top of each other during search
// kate walker and kakarato.
//
// not checking for invalid inputs
//
// search feature, searches when displaying tagged elements only
//
// re-render page after delete maybe? you could have just one user and after
// this user is deleted you want to show no contacts message.
//
// space between tags, input validation
